# Getting Started

### Instructions

Requirements:
-node.js installed on your computer

# How to run:

- git clone this repo
- change the directory to "ecommerce"
- npm install (This installs all the dependencies)
- npm start (Runs the app in the localhost://3000)

# If you run into some issues try this :

- Delete package-lock.json
- Delete node_modules file
- Run npm install
- Run npm start

# NOTES :

- If you are running windows 11 then you might have too high version of node.js. This issue recently happened on one of my projects and it broke my dependencies.

- I am aware that I should put my api keys in the environment variables folder but I didn't do this for the sake of testing this software.
  If I didn't do this then you would have to sign-up and get your own API key and that would be too much hassle for an internship task.
